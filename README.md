Here’s a professional, GitHub-ready `README.md` file for your `ProductsApp` project:

---

```markdown
# 🛍️ ProductsApp

A SwiftUI-based iOS app that displays a list of products fetched from a remote API. Built with modern `async/await` concurrency and follows the MVVM architecture.

---

## 📱 Features

- 🔄 Fetches real-time product data from `https://dummyjson.com/products`
- 🖼 Asynchronously loads product images with `AsyncImage`
- 📦 Uses Swift Concurrency (`async/await`) for network requests
- 🧠 Implements MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns
- 🧪 Includes a test target for future unit tests

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The project uses **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel):

```

ProductsApp/
├── Models/
│   └── Product.swift
├── ViewModel/
│   └── ViewModel.swift
├── Views/
│   └── ContentView\.swift
├── Networking/
│   └── NetworkManager.swift (WIP)
└── Entry Point/
└── ProductsAppApp.swift

````

- **Model**: `Product.swift` represents the JSON data structure.
- **ViewModel**: `ViewModel.swift` handles networking and publishes the product list.
- **View**: `ContentView.swift` renders the product list in a SwiftUI `List`.
